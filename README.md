## Accessibility
- We entered our website through AccessScan to check we were compliant with with ADA standards. Our website is ADA-compliant as shown below:


## Device Testing

We have tested the site with the following devices:

- Android Google Pixel 5
- Desktop
- Android Tablet
- Chrome Developer Tools (Simulating for all available device options)

The site functioned as expected except for the loading on the guide page with the map & Youth Hostel content on smaller devices.
  
## Browser Testing

Testing has been done on the following browsers:

- Chrome (& Developer tools)
- Opera
- Safari

## Testing Breakdown
- We completed the following tests on all mentioned devices and browsers including the steps & outcomes from said tests. Any noted bugs are explained below.


## Testing user stories

We tested our site vs the user stories:

## Known Bugs

## During development, we found these bugs and fixed them:

### Nav bar disapperance

- On smaller devices, the navbar burger logo to indicate the nav bar would disappear when switching to the guide page.
- To fix this issue, we chekced the Home & Contact nav bar, realised they had no issues and copied the code back into the guide HTML.

### Carousel Images poor quality on smaller devices

- The carousel originally loaded on all devices, however the images appeared pixelated & poorly rendered.
- To fix this issue, as a design choice, we decided to remove the carousel feature to mobile users to keep a high quality of user experience.

## During development and testing, these are the current bugs:

### Content on smaller devices

- The content when deployed on a smaller device reshuffles the image to the bottom of the container.
- The text in the last paragraph changes to the default font rather than our applied styling in the CSS folder. This is specific to Android.
