                <h1 class="heading">What is workplace equality and diversity?</h1>
                <p>Equality and diversity in a workplace mean a handful of things. They’re about treating each member of
                    staff fairly and the same, respecting them for their age, race, gender, cultural background, skills,
                    beliefs, sexual orientation, career experiences and more. But how are equality and diversity
                    different? <br><br> Equality is about making sure everyone has equal opportunity and is treated the
                    same, regardless of their characteristics. Diversity, on the other hand, is more than equality. It’s
                    about creating a culture that values individual differences for the benefit of individuals,
                    businesses and society. For a workplace to be diverse, it will typically include a range of people
                    with differences between them, such as age, ethnicity, religion, beliefs, race, sex and sexual
                    orientation and more</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-md-6 border learn">
                <h1 class="heading">What is inclusion in the workplace?</h1>
                <p>Having a diverse workplace has a whole host of benefits that can give your company a competitive
                    edge. As well as bringing a wide range of ideas, skills and resources to your business, it also
                    brings unique energy, which is invaluable — especially in an office environment.
                    <br><br>Organisations that embrace diversity also invite a wider talent pool, allowing them to reap
                    the rewards of a broader market and increased productivity. What’s more, the organisation will gain
                    respect from outsiders, which will boost its popularity and profile within the community. <br><br>
                    There’s more. A business that promotes diversity and inclusion will also see the following benefits:
                <ul>
                    <li>Absences decrease when employees are happy at work</li>
                    <li>Teamwork and collaboration thrive in a diverse environment</li>
                    <li>Employee loyalty and retention is strong when employees are understood</li>
                    <li>Discrimination claims are less likely to occur with the correct policies and procedures in place
                    </li>
                </ul>
                    In addition to nurturing happy, productive and loyal employees through excellent diversity and inclusion
                    practices, how you act in this area as a business will be relevant to your compliance with the Equality
                    Act 2010.<br><br>At The HR Dept, we’ll ensure that your business is compliant through your policies, procedures and
                    contracts. We review each business individually and take a personal approach with suggestions on how to
                    improve diversity, inclusion and equality in the workplace to drive your business forward.<br><br> To learn more about how your business will benefit from our services, give us a call or drop message on any of the below social links.
